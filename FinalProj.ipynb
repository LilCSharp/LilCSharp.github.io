    "Accoding to NPR, as of May 10, 2021, there have been 194 mass shootings in the period from Jan. 1, 2021 to May 10, 2021. The consideration of mass shootings and the response that public bodies take in minimizing their damage and responding to them have become focal points of American society. K-12 schools across the country have adopted shooter drills to inhibit the quantity of deaths. After Parkland, Walmart adopted policies to restrict the sale of guns to all consumers under the age of 21, so as to pseudo-federalize age limitations. Clearly, many different entities are looking to reduce the quantity of mass shooting phenomena that occur, but what methods work, and what methods don't? Colorado was one of the first to formalize \"red-flag laws,\" which allow for the sale of guns to be restricted to any persons deemed a threat to public safety by judicial process, and many political pundits argue that mental health program expansion reduces the probability of \"snaps\" that cause mass shootings. In this investigation, I'm going to teach you how to collect the data and find out."

    "There are two approaches towards mass shooting legislation that are commonly seen within our media cycles: mass shooting reduction via mental health program expansion, and mass shooting reduction via stricter laws for acquiring and keeping guns. We would like to explore the effectiveness of both. To evaluate the effectiveness of mental health programs on mass shooting reduction, we need data on the quantity of mass shootings by state over time, and we need data on the quantity of funds spent on mental health programs by state over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of gun laws on mass shooting reduction, we need to find data representing the types of laws that each state has, prefferably over time, and reference it with the quantity of mass shootings that have occurred."

This database classifies a mass shooting as any event in which a perpetrator uses a gun to injure or kill 4 or more people. It collects occurrences of mass shootings through localized reporting, but it mandates the provision of official sources like a police report or government acknowledgement of the event to be counted, so it should, in theory, be reliable.

    "Well, on this site here: https://www.samhsa.gov/grants-awards-by-state, SAMHSA provides a list of grant awards by state by year that happens to have a total mental health grant category. Swell! Now, we can use requests to extract the data from the multitude of sites. One problem though: how do we know what to extract? Well, looking through the HTML of each site, we can see that there is only one occurrence of total spending in the entire file, so we can simply use regular expressions to parse it! Technically, we could read the text here and organize it by tags, but since we know the source, and the structure of the website is non-traditional, it was easier to read the html of the site and figure out what to extract rather than create additional code to look for any differentiation in where total health funding appeared."

To re-iterate, we are using a database that classifies mass shootings as any gun violence event in which 4+ people are injured or killed. Perhaps one insight that can be had is whether the total deaths due to mass shootings has increased over time.\n",

While 2021 appears to decrease to historical levels, 2021 is still an ongoing year, and this dataset was collected as of April, so 2021 should be considered a full representation of the year."

It is entirely possible that data demonstrates relations with another variable, and that it can be used to imply many qualities. However, that does not necessarily mean that there is some particular quality of the data the requires that the other variable take on some quantity. The possibility of hidden variables is always present, and when experiments cannot be performed, information must always be checked for additional factors that affect its qualities.\n",

By illustrating the specific locales of mass shootings, we can specify the regions where shootings are prevalent, and make better prediction based on other knowledge about the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we illustrate the quantity of mass shootings that each of the states have had in the period of 2016-2021. As can be seen from the map, the mass shooting frequency appears to be highest in Illinois and California, and generally pretty high in the Mid-West/lower North-East by New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. After these regions, the South has a pretty low mass-shooting frequency, and the West/Great Plains has the lowest frequency of all the regions. Curiously, the states with among the highest mass shooting frequencies are California, New York, Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Population-wise, these are very big states, which further demonstrates the relationship between population and mass shootings. Now, we know that these are mostly situated in states with many people, and that occurrences tend to drop in less populous regions."

    "In this part of the data science pipeline, we determine whether the effect that variables have on one another is different from what would be observed due to random chance, and we use this information to make prediction on how variables behave in relation to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section, we observed an extremely suspicious relationship in which mass shooting frequency appeared to increase with mental health spending and population. Now, we'll actually test whether there exists a significant relationship. The variables in question are distinctly numerical, and the zeroes are of relevance because 0 population means no people (and you can't have negative populations), and 0 occurrences means no shootings (and you can't have negative shootings). So, we are dealing with ratio variables here, and we want to find the change in shooting frequency for every unit change in these values. Thus, we should use multivariate regression to form a least-squares descriptor of the data. If the variance of this descriptor is low with respect to the number of samples, we can claim the the depicted relationship implies a significant difference from simple randomization. We could also use machine learning, but my objective is not to necessarily fit an optimal regression line for the purposes of prediction. My objective is to determine whether there is enough evidence to suggest a relationship, so I will instead use OLS, which contains packages for computing hypothesis testing, as it is faster to use to conduct the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the null hypothesis that we are testing is: there exists no significant difference between the variation of mass shooting frequencies, mental health spending, and population, and the standard variance of the mass shooting frequencies. The alternative hypothesis is that there does exist a significant difference between the variances of the model of the variables and the standard variance of mass shooting frequencies."

We now want to test whether gun law restrictions actually affect mass shooting frequency. Both the number of shootings and laws cannot be negative, and the zeroes are meaningful because they represent a fundamental lack of action. So, both the response variable and the independent variable are ratio variables. To determine the correlation, we could fit the model using machine learning. However, we are at a distinct lack of significant training data, and the OLS package can already do univariate regression using least-squares, so it is ultimately unnecessary. Therefore, the OLS package will be used to conduct linear regression, and ANOVA will be used to do the hypothesis testing on the regression."

    "Mass shootings are a problem that needs to be dutifuly addressed. The quantity of mass shooting events overall shows an increasing trend based on the charts that we were able to compute. However, this problem is very multifaceted, and the solution is not entirely clear. To re-iterate, two of the most common proposals for reducing the frequency of mass-shootings are through increasing access to mental health resources, and through installing more restrictions on threats to public safety from having legal access to guns. \n",
    "\n",
    "While no evidence has been presented that shows that higher mental health spending worsens shooting events, we have shown that there is a non-trivial increasing relationship between mental health spending by state and mass-shooting occurences. This is very likely due to the fact the states with higher populations objectively have more funding to spend on these programs, and have more mass shootings, but the issue remains that in states that can afford higher mental health spending, there is no sign of reduction of mass shooting occurrences relative to what is linearly predicted by states with lower populations and mental health funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the matter of legal restrictions, based on the statistics collected here, there is no evidence that stronger laws on felons/legal threats for guns purchases affect the frequency of mass shootings. This is supported both by hypothesis testing, and intuitively. Looking at the map, state with relatively loose gun policies, like Nebraska or Montana, have practically little shootings compared to states with stricter policies, like New York or Maryland. That said, states with the looser policies tend to be small in population, so it is entirely possible that the reason why legal restriction have little effect is because population is the bigger confounding variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the available data shows that neither increasing legal restrictions on accessing guns nor increased mental health spending will have any great effect on reducing the quantity of mass shootings. As legislative policies, these solutions must be considered in tandem with other ideas that do show success in reducing mass shooting activity."
